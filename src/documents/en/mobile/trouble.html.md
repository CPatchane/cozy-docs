## Send debug informations

When you hit a problem with the application, you can send us a message with the application logs, so we can try to understand and fix the problem.
Here’s how to send the logs:


 * click on the icon on top left corner and select Configuration inside the menu

## Note about self-signed certificates
About Self hosted instances, you probably have a self-signed certificate.
Cozy Mobile won't recognize it until you validate it on your mobile. See
[there](http://davdroid.bitfire.at/faq/entry/importing-a-certificate)
for instruction on how to do it.

## I don't have an Android Phone
Let us know on the [forum](https://forum.cozy.io/) you would like to see the application for your system!
