Our infrastructure is located in Roubaix, France.


## Is my data safe?

Cozy has put in place several features in order to protect the userâ€™s data. For instance, all the passwords you store inside Cozy are encrypted using your main password, so even in case of data breach, your bank or email account credentials will stay safe.
We also perform daily backups of your data, so we can restore them if needed.


## How much data can I store on my server

We provide 40GB of storage with each instance (well, technically 60GB are available, but we recommend for now not to use more than 40GB)
