## Where is your datacenter located?

Our infrastructure is located in France at Roubaix.


## For how long my Cozy will be available?

Because you are an early adopter of Cozy, we offer you a free 3 years subscription.


## What is your business model?

We are currently in beta so currently all Cozy instances are free.
That is why we expect feedback from you. Soon, we will build partnerships with distributors like hosting providers. Once done, having its Cozy will require a monthly subscription fee. We will share revenue with our distributors. This is how Cozy Cloud will make money.

## Are my data safe?

All the passwords you store inside Cozy are encrypted using your main password, so even in case of data breach, your bank or email account credentials will stay safe.
We perform daily backups of your data, so we can restore them in case of problem.


## How much data can I store on my server

We provide 40GB of storage with each instance (well, technically 60GB are available, but we recommend for now not to use more than 40GB).
